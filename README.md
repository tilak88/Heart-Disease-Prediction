# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques with a focus on logistic regression. This project aims to build a predictive model based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing 1,025 entries and 14 attributes.

# Key Features
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between attributes.

Model Building: Implement a logistic regression model to predict the presence of heart disease.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using accuracy metrics on training and test datasets.

Predictive System: Develop a system to predict heart disease for new data input.

# Technologies Used
For this project, I will use the following libraries:
`NumPy`: For numerical operations and array handling.

`Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.

`Matplotlib (Pyplot)`: For data visualization.

`scikit-learn (sklearn)`: For implementing the logistic regression model.
